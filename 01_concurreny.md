# Introduction to Concurrency:

Concurrency is a fundamental concept that describes two or more separate activities happening at the same time. While often discussed in the context of computer science and programming, we implement concurrency daily in our lives without even thinking about it.

### Daily Life Examples of Concurrency
We are natural multi-taskers, which is essentially human concurrency. Think about common activities you perform simultaneously:
- Listening to music while solving a math problem.
- Walking and talking at the same time.
- Using your hands to perform different tasks, where one hand does one thing and your another hand does something else.

### Why Concurrency Matters in Computing

In software, concurrency enables programs to perform multiple operations efficiently. Consider a web browser: it can download images, render pages, and respond to user clicks all at the same time. Without concurrency, the browser would freeze until each operation finished, leading to poor user experience.
